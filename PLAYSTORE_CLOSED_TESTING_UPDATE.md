# Updating Play Store Description During Closed Testing

## Important: For Apps in Closed Testing

When your app is in **closed testing** (internal testing or closed track), the Store Presence section has **limited availability** because your app isn't publicly visible yet. Here's what you need to know:

---

## Option 1: Prepare Store Listing for Future (Recommended)

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Access Play Console**
   - Go to https://play.google.com/console
   - Sign in with your developer account
   - Select "Athreya's Math Workout"

2. **Check if Main Store Listing is Available**
   - In the left sidebar, expand **"Grow"** or look for **"Store presence"**
   - Click on **"Main store listing"**
   
3. **If "Main store listing" is available:**
   - ✅ You can update the description now!
   - Follow the normal update process (see below)
   - Changes will be saved but won't be visible until you publish to production
   
4. **If "Main store listing" is grayed out or not visible:**
   - ⚠️ You need to set up your store listing first
   - This is required before promoting to production anyway

## Important Notes for Closed Testing

### What Testers See:
- Testers in closed testing don't see the full Play Store listing
- They get access through a special testing link
- They see a simplified page with basic app info

### What You Should Prepare:
- Even though testers don't see it, prepare your full store listing now
- This saves time when you're ready to launch publicly
- All changes are saved in draft until you promote to production

### Timeline:
- **Store listing updates in closed testing:** Saved immediately, visible only in console
- **After promoting to production:** Store listing goes live after app review (1-7 days)

## Quick Fix: If You Can't Find Store Presence

**Location 1 (New UI):**

```

### Still Can't Find It?

**A:** Yes! You can (and should) prepare the store listing even during testing. Changes won't be public until you promote to production.

### Q: Do I need to submit a new version to update the description?
**A:** No, store listing changes (description, screenshots) don't require a new app version.

### Q: When will my description changes be visible?
**A:** Not until you promote your app to production and it's approved by Google.

## Need Help Finding the Right Section?

Take a screenshot of your Play Console left sidebar and check if you see:
- ✅ "Grow" section with "Store presence"
- ✅ "Main store listing" option
- ❌ If missing, look for "Dashboard" to see setup requirements

The UI layout can vary slightly based on:
- Account type (individual vs organization)
- App status (draft, testing, production)
- Play Console version (they update the UI periodically)

---

**Bottom Line:** You can prepare and update your store listing description right now, even during closed testing. The changes will be saved and will go live when you promote to production! 🚀
